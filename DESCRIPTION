Description: This app is used to let the student learn about the assumptions of models in ANOVA.
	     First, explore the assumptions for each model and how to exam them with plot.
	     Second, use the drag and drop game to math the assumptions with each model.
	     Third, choose the appropriate plot to exam each assumption.
LearningObjectives: c(
    "The student will learn to understand what are the assumptions for different ANOVA models, and how to test those assumptions."
